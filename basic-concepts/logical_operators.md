# Logical operators

Last time we looked at arithmetic operators, but what if we want to compare values? This is what *logical operators* are all about.
Now, instead of performing a calculation and returning a value as result, what do logical operators return?

All logical operators return `bool` to state whether the comparison is `true` or `false`.
