# Overblade's C++ guide

Hello and welcome to my C++ guide!

Here you will learn everything about C++ you'll need to get started as a beginner. Even if you already know the basics there's plenty of advanced content too, so
there should be something for everyone.
You might be wondering: *Why is another person writing a tutorial about C++? Aren't there enough on the internet already?*

Well, you're right. There **are** a lot of tutorials on the internet. 

However, this is a *guide*. So I won't only show you how to write C++ code but also how to write it *well*. Additionally, I try to make this as unique and precise
as possible so you can easily grasp all of the concepts I teach here.

Enough talking about the guide itself, let's rewind back to the start:

## Why learning C++ is useful

Well, good question. You might have heard rumors about *C++ being old* or *difficult* and not *good for beginners*.
They are right. Or at least, partially. Let's decompose each statement:

- C++ is old

Correct, no way to disagree. C++ appeared first in 1985 and was standardized in 1998.
Does it make it bad? No. Unlike other old programming languages that died due to being replaced by others, C++ is so fundamentally rooted into today's code bases
there is no trend of it ever dying out soon. The standard is revised every three years. *Three years.*

- C++ is difficult

Correct and wrong. As you'll soon realize, C++ is based on C and lots of concepts are similar, so the base of it is quite easy to learn. Also, difficulty is a measure of
comprehensability: Depending on what and how you learn it, it might be easy or it might be hard. I try to make it as simple to understand as possible without leaving out
crucial details. Remember, *the devil is in the details* and this also applies here.
Still, some concepts are really hard to understand and there is no way to master them without lots of practice, unfortunately. You'll see what I mean much later in this guide
so be prepared for lots of pain when you end up there (yes, I like to dramatize).

- C++ is not good for beginners

Wrong. Despite there being languages that really focus on this aspect it doesn't make C++ a bad choice for beginners. C++'s primary aspect is not easiness or simplicity.
It gives you lots of tools and it's your job to learn how to use them. Or, basically, C++ gives you a fork, a hammer, a saw, a car and a fusion reactor. Each has its uses
and you have to learn where to use which tool. The base tools are as simple as in other language and nobody forces you to apply advanced concepts, so claiming C++ is
*generally* difficult is not correct. It can be easy, it can be hard, it can be pain, but that greatly depends on the level of proficiency you want to achieve.

With C++, you can do lots of stuff on nearly every platform which gives you great flexibility and control. But remember, with great control comes great responsibility.
This is exactly the reason why I won't hide any details in the guide: It's important how C++ works, and when you know it things start to make much more sense anyways.

## Structure of the guide

The guide will consist of individual "chapters" which I called "Acts". Kinda think of it like some kind of story where each chapter builds upon the previous one.
Following Acts are planned as of now:

- Getting Started
- Basic Concepts
- Classes and Structures
- Advanced Concepts
- Multithreading
- Expert Concepts
- Compiler Implementation Details

The later the Act the more complex and difficult it will become; however, there is nothing you can't learn. It just requires quite a bit more brain power to wrap your head around.

Each Act consists of individual guides where I'll first expose you with an example problem, then you'll get an explanation what *tool* can help us there with additional example 
use cases.
And last but not least, there will be some exercises for you to practice what you've learnt.

I recommend to walk through up to 3 guides per day in the easier Acts, later not more than 1 per day.

## TL;DR

So, what are you waiting for? Let's jump right into how we set our environment up.
